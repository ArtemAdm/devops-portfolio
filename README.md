# DevOps Portfolio 🚀

This is a curated collection of infrastructure and automation tools I’ve built, used, and refined over time — from production-grade CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure notifications and GitOps-based delivery.

## 🧰 What’s inside

- **CI/CD Pipelines** – Jenkins, GitHub Actions, reusable Shared Libraries
- **Infrastructure Notifications** – Adaptive Cards for Microsoft Teams (Slack support planned)
- **Terraform Modules** – VPC, EKS, IAM, scalable infrastructure-as-code
- **ArgoCD Configs** – App of Apps, sync hooks, GitOps structure
- **Ansible Playbooks** – deployment automation, provisioning
- **Kubernetes Manifests** – Helm charts, raw YAML, best practices
- **Scripts & Tools** – Bash utilities, health checks, helper flows

Each section has its own documentation and usage examples.

## 🎯 Goal

To share my approach to building, managing, and scaling infrastructure —
with a strong focus on **automation, visibility**, and **clarity in delivery processes**.

---

## 👀 Audience

Teams, recruiters, engineers, and curious minds
who want to understand how I build infrastructure systems from the ground up —
modular, observable, and production-ready.
